This project is part of IVT assignment. We chose a library to work on it and we divided the tasks like this:

1) Fares: built a UI for the library for manual testing, then he executed and documented the manual tests. 
He invetigated the built framework: pip with Oussama and managed to do it together.
2) Oussama: participated in building the UI with Fares by searching together and finding tkinter framework
which is used for building the UI.
Added the built framework to the project (Pip), added pytest and pytest coverage to be able to see the result of the tests.
3) Mahdi: set up yhe SonarQube for the project and worked with Oussama to find the coverage tool for the tests,
which is pytest coverage.
4) Meri and Ahmed: worked together on setting up the workflow using GitHub Actions for the project and added mypy and flake8 
which are external tools used for development workflow, that assist in code analysis and quality assurance.
