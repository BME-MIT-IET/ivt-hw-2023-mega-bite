# Description

we decided to work with a python library that offers various mathematical algorithm. the librarie is composed of 27 different modules that covers list arrays math and string operations.the goal is to offer Minimal and clean example implementations of data structures and algorithms in Python 3.

we decided to work with these four module in an attempt to varie the possible scenarios
-maths:offer a varity of algorithms that deals with decimal number.
-bit:offer a varity of algorithms that deals with binaries number.
-string:offer a varity of algorithms that deals with strings operations.
-sort:offer a varity of algorithms that sorts list(the result or complexity of algorithm may differs).
